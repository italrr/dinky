# dinky

It's an attempt of creating a markup language capable of generating article/document like pages into static and interactive mediums such as PDF, Images and HTML pages. It's akin to offer something similar to LaTeX and HTML without having knowning either's specifics, or having to download hundreds of megabytes of dependencies in a easy to use syntax.

# Syntax

`dinky` is based on the usage of brackets ([]) to organize the content. A single Bracket is a called a block, and it automatically uses the entire line that breaks down to the next line when there's an overflow. So, ideally, each parragraph should go in brackets.
